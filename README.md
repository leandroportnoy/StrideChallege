# Stride Challenge

- This simple project was a challenge that I had to do a reading from Ricky and Morty API.  I used a list to represent the items from API using a simple structure of a RecyclerView
- I didn't follow any architecture model because I had only one hour to build and a never did this kind of challenge in my life :)
- So I recorded this project in my repository just to have a new Android  project in my portfolio

In this project I used:
- Kotlin
- Layout Constraints
- Retrofit2
- Retrofit2 - ConverterGSON
- Picasso2
